# NSDC-Snake-Species-Classification
### This project was done in collaboration with a team of ten peers, though all code in this repository is original.
### The aim of this project was to first web scrape images of various snake species from Google Images, and then train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify them with high accuracy.
### We focused on snakes because snakes are cool

- Web scraped snake images using Selenium, aggregating a data set of 3000+ images.
- Manually cleaned and preprocessed the data set.
- Built multiple convolutional neural networks with Keras and employed image augmentation, achieving a  97.57% test accuracy.
- Worked with a team to graphically design, script, and perform a presentation.
